# VanillaMonteCarlo

This project aims to price derivatives using Numerical Probabilities including:

    Monte Carlo simulations
    Variance reduction
    Brownian bridge,
    ...

The project will be completed on a continual basis.

This should include derivatives like :

    European and American Vanilla Call and Put
    Best-of Options
    Lookback Options
    Asian Options
    ....

Although closed-form formulas are available for the less complex derivatives (value and greeks), I found more interesting to build MonteCarlo simulations to price those vanilla derivatives 
and to increase the interest bit by bit by including more and more complex derivatives like the path-dependent ones.

I am available to get any feedback.
